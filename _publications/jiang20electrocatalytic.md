**Abstract**Detailed atomistic understanding of the vanadium redox reactions taking place at electrode/water interfaces is key for improvement of the power density of vanadium redox flow batteries. In this work, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics-based metadynamics simulations to examine V<sup>2+</sup>/V<sup>3+</sup> and VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>/VO<sup>2+</sup> redox reactions at the oxygen-functionalized graphite (112̅0) surface contrasting the behavior of O–C═O and C═O groups. By evaluating free-energy barriers, we reveal that the kinetics of adsorption and desorption processes for every vanadium ion is more favorable in the case of O–C═O. We also find that interfacial VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>/VO<sup>2+</sup> transformations should be more rapid than those observed for the V<sup>2+</sup>/V<sup>3+</sup> couple, with the V<sup>3+</sup> desorption being the rate-limiting step of the overall process. The obtained results suggest that increasing the content of O–C═O groups on carbon-based electrodes should help enhance the power density of vanadium redox flow batteries.
