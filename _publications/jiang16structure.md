**Abstract** A molecular level understanding of the properties of electroactive vanadium species in aqueous solution is crucial for enhancing the performance of vanadium redox flow batteries. Here, we employ Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory to investigate the hydration structures, first hydrolysis reaction, and diffusion of aqueous V<sup>2+</sup>, V<sup>3+</sup>, VO<sup>2+</sup>, and VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ions at 300 K. The results indicate that the first hydration shell of both V<sup>2+</sup> and V<sup>3+</sup> contains six water molecules, while VO<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated to five and VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> to three water ligands. The first acidity constants (pKa) estimated using metadynamics simulations are 2.47, 3.06, and 5.38 for aqueous V<sup>3+</sup>, VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and VO<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, while V<sup>2+</sup> is predicted to be a fairly weak acid in aqueous solution with a pKa value of 6.22. We also show that the presence of chloride ions in the first coordination sphere of the aqueous VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion has a significant impact on water hydrolysis leading to a much higher pKa value of 4.8. This should result in a lower propensity of aqueous VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> for oxide precipitation reaction in agreement with experimental observations for chloride-based electrolyte solutions. The computed diffusion coefficients of vanadium species in water at room temperature are found to increase as V<sup>3+</sup> < VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> < VO<sup>2+</sup> < V<sup>2+</sup> and thus correlate with the simulated hydrolysis constants, namely, the higher the pK<sub>a</sub> value, the greater the diffusion coefficient.
