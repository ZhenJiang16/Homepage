**Abstract** Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have recently aroused significant interest due to the interesting physics controlling their properties and potential application in nonvolatile memory devices. In this work, we propose a new concept to design high-performance FTJs based on ferroelectric/polar-oxide composite barriers. Using density functional theory calculations, we model electronic and transport properties of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>/PbTiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/LaNiO<sub>3</sub> tunnel junctions and demonstrate that an ultrathin polar LaAlO<sub>3</sub>(001) layer strongly enhances their performance. We predict a tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect in these FTJs with an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 10<sup>4</sup> and ON state resistance as low as about 1 kΩμm<sup>2</sup>. Such an enhanced performance is driven by the ionic charge at the PbTiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub> interface, which significantly increases transmission across the FTJ when the ferroelectric polarization of PbTiO<sub>3</sub> is pointing against the intrinsic electric field produced by this ionic charge. This is due to the formation of a two-dimensional (2D) electron or hole gas, depending on the LaAlO<sub>3</sub> termination being (LaO)<sup>+</sup> or (AlO<sub>2</sub>)<sup>−</sup>, respectively, which is formed to screen the polarization charge of the nonuniform polarization state. This 2D electron (hole) gas can be switched ON and OFF by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization, resulting in the giant TER effect. The proposed design suggests a new direction for creating FTJs with a stable and reversible ferroelectric polarization, a sizable TER effect, and a low-resistance-area product, as required for memory applications.
