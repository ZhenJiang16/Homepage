excerpt: "In this project, the atomic mechanisms and associated thermodynamic overpotential of discharging/charging reactions on Mo<sub>3</sub>P and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>electrodes. Two different discharging pathways (solution and surface pathway) are investigated in high (DMSO) and low (CH<sub>3</sub>CN) donor number solvents. The meachanism and kientic behavior of interfacial redox reactions and discharge product transportation principles are studied in explicit aprotic solvent and most thermodynamic favourable electrode facets. <br/> **Methods**: Computational Lithium electrode based thermodynamic free energy calculations, DFT-derived overpotentials, ab initio molecular dynamics (Born Openheimer molecular dynamics), slow growth simulation, blue-moon ensemble, Einstein diffusion equation, static DFT, density of states, band structures, HOMO-LUMO. <br/> **Software package**: VASP, p4vasp, vaspkit, Travis, VESTA, VMD, Inkscape, Latex, moviemaker. <br/> **Publications**: *J. Phys. Chem. C* 125(40), 21873-21881 (**2021**); *Adv. Mater.* 2004028 (**2020**)"
