The Li-ion batteries are among the most well-known energy storages in today's society, which are most commonly found in portable electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops. The two technical bottlenecks restrickting their further promotion are the limited energy density and charging rate. Recently, we have successfully demonstrated the growth of high-quality, single-crystal layers of T-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, aligned in a way that allows larger-capacity lithium ions to move significantly faster. Multiple previously unknown transitions in the materialâ€™s structure are modeled as the concentration of lithium ions changed, together with the observation of the electronic switch from insulator to metal. Such a dramatic shift delivers the resistivity of the material decreases by a factor of 100 billion.
