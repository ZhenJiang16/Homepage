title: "<span style='color: $twitter-color;'>**Project (d): Electrocatalysis**</span>"
excerpt: "I am also experienced in the atomic simulations of electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reactions (CO<sub>2</sub>RR). The mechansitic study together with free energy calculations based on computational hydrogen electrode model are performed. I investigated the overpotentials of ORR on the FeN<sub>4</sub>-dopped graphene with a family of face-center cubic (fcc) metal supports. More ab initio calculations are being performed to identify effecient catalysts for HER, OER, ORR, and CO<sub>2</sub>RR. <br/> **Methods**: Ab initio thermodynamics, DFT-derived overpotentials, electron density analysis, d band center, surface energy, lattice mismatch. <br/> **Software package**: VASP, p4vasp, vaspkit, VESTA, Inkscape, Latex. <br/> **Publication**: *J. Phys. Chem. C* 123, 30335â€“30340 (**2019**)"
