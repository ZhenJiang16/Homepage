The issue of carbon neutral has been increasing more and more attentions for a green and sustainable environment. However, the inertness of CO<sub>2</sub> challenges the effecient conversion to other fuel gases and chemicals for recycling in our daily industries and lives. Through our efforts, we found the surface coating techniques will greatly increase the efficiency of trimolybdenum phosphides (Mo3P) toward electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reactions (CO<sub>2</sub>RR). The decorated imidazole-functionalized Mo<sub>3</sub>P (ImF-Mo<sub>3</sub>P) surface directionally convert CO<sub>2</sub> to propane (high energy-density fuel gas) with a high Faradic efficiency of 91.4%. However, the pristine Mo<sub>3</sub>P appears to be a mediocre CO<sub>2</sub>RR catalyst, producing significant CO and H<sub>2</sub> as major products. The <sup>*</sup>Im layer is effective to increase the electronic conductivity of solid-state catalyst, meanwhile it strengthens the <sup>*</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> and <sup>*</sup>CO adsorption on the catalysts by providing columbic force and hydrogen bonds to form ultimate propane products. Through designing such a hybrid catalyst with ionic liquids, we open new avenues to find more achievable catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub>RR.
