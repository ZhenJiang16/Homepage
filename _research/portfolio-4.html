title: "<span style='color: $youtube-color;'>Project (c): Thin Film Growth Techniques</span>"
excerpt: "A new growth and stabilization approach named stromataxy is developed for both epitaxial and non-epitaxial growth of metastable P6<sub>3</sub>cm phase ScFeO<sub>3</sub> thin film on various substrates. It is a method based on controlling the structure during the initial stages of material growth to dictate phase formation. I performed ab initio simulations to show the mechanisms and thermodynamic performance for the layer-by-layer P6<sub>3</sub>cm phase ScFeO<sub>3</sub> growth on sapphire substrate. The stromataxy is promising as a viable option for accessing polymorphs that are close in energy, that are difficult to differentiate by strain, or that lack a well epitaxially matched substrate. <br/> **Methods**: Ab initio thermodynamics, epitaxial and non-epitaxial growth, density of states, CI-NEB. <br/> **Software package**: Quantum Esspresso, XCrySDen, Inkscape. <br/> **Publications**: *Chem. Mater.* 33(18), 7423-7431 (**2021**)"
