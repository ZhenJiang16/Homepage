The Lithium-air batteries are found to offer extremely high theoretical energy density, as strong contenders for bringing conventional batteries into the next generation. Our ab initio thermodynamic calculations demonstrated that the TMPs (Mo<sub>3</sub>P) and transition metal oxides (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) show higher competitiveness by delivering a low overpotential (&#951; < 0.2 V) over traditional metal (Au) electrodes (&eta; > 0.8 V). The discharging LiO<sub>2</sub> monomer products was found favorable to be transported away from the electrode surface with the assistant of high donor number electrolytes, which delivers a solution model of discharging products growth mechanism and a toroidal morphology of ultimate discharging products. Therefore, the deactivation and passivation of the electrode due to the gradual covering of the surface by discharge products can be avoided. In comparison, electrolytes with low donor number solvents were found to be inert to transport LiO<sub>2</sub> adsorbates off the electrode surface in both thermodynamic and kinetic behavior. The two metrics of electrolytes (donor number and HOMOâ€“LUMO gap) are found to be inversely linearly correlated, demonstrating the long-term activity and sustainable low overpotentials of electrodes strongly depend on the electron donor ability of aprotic solvents in the electrolytes.
