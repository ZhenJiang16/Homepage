excerpt: "We designed the heterostructures of Ni/HfO<sub>2</sub> to study the magnetoelectric effect at the HfO<sub>2</sub>-based ferroelectric-ferromagnetic interface. In addition, we proposed new concept to design high-performance FTJs based on LaNiO<sub>3</sub>/PbTiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/LaNiO<sub>3</sub> ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). The proposed design suggests a new direction for creating FTJs with a stable and reversible ferroelectric polarization, a sizable tunneling electroresistance effect, and a low-resistance-area product, as required for memory applications. <br/> **Methods**: DFT, Density of States, polarization, electron density analysis. <br/> **Software package**: VASP, p4vasp, Quantum Espresso, VESTA <br/> **Publications**: *Nano. Lett.* 19, 7385–7393 (**2019**); *Phys. Rev. Applied* 12, 024044–024050 (**2019**)"
