title: "<span style='color: $youtube-color;'>**Project (a): All-Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries**</span>"
excerpt: "In this project, I studied 1) the solution chemistry of four vanadium species in aqueous electrolyte and 2) interfacial chemsitry of redox reactions of aqueous vanadium species on the oxygen functionalized graphite surface. The above studies are mainly served for the investigation to improve the energy density and power density of such a redox flow battery. The structure, diffusion, stability and side self-discharging reaction of vanadium species are studied in the explicit aqueous solvent at room temperature. The mechanistic and kinetic informations of interfacial redox reactions between different oxidation states of vanadiums are obtained from enhanced free energy sampling towards the rare events by first-principles studies. <br/> **Methods**: Ab initio molecular dynamics (Car Parrinello molecular dynamics), metadynamics, Einstein diffusion equation, Marcus-theory electron transfer, Bader charge analysis, electron density difference maps; static DFT. <br/> **Software package**: NwChem, Travis, VESTA, VMD, Inkscape, Latex, moviemaker. <br/> **Publications**: *ACS Appl. Energy Mater.* 3(8), 7543-7549 (**2020**); *J. Phys. Chem. B* 123, 3976–3983 (**2019**); *ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces* 10 (24), 20621–20626 (**2018**); *Phys. Chem. Chem.
