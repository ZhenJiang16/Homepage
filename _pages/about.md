Welcome! I am a postdoctoral research fellow (2019-present) in the Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). My current supervisor is Prof. Andrew M Rappe. I am working on multple projects at UPenn, including Li-air batteries, Li-ion batteries, electrocatalysis on topological insulator surfaces, thin film growth techniques, etc. 

In August, 2019, I earned my Ph.D in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincolni (UNL). My doctoral thesis is firs-principles study of all-vanadium redox flow batteries, which was completed under the supervise of Prof. Vitaly Alexandrov at UNL. Besides the vanadium redox flow battereis, I also worked on the study of oxygen evolution/reduction reactions in fuel cell. 

Before came to USA (Jan, 2016), I had obtained my master degree at Xiamen University, China. My co-superviosrs are Prof. Wei Wu and Prof. Peifeng Su. During my master period (2011-2014), I contributed to the development of an generalized Kohn-Sham energy decomposition analysis (GKS-EDA) method complied on Gamess software package. In addition, my bachelor degree in pharmacy is from Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, China.

During holidays, I like to travel. Dream to travel the world!
